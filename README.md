# Introduction

**QuickServe** is a local development server made for quickly previewing `.html` and `.md` files.
Just run it, and it serves your current workspace—no setup or config needed.

It’s built mainly for HTML and Markdown, but supports other file types too. Great for quick testing or writing docs.
